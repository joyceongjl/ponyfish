Find out age and growth and maturity information for _Equulites leuciscus_ (whipfin ponyfish) in the Philippines

## Some information
* There are several old names for this species, e.g. _Leiognathus leuciscus_, check [WoRMS](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=398520) for others.
* Read in the papers that age is assumed to be 1-2 years old, although another paper said a related species could live up to 6 years old.
* Note that for a species to be aged using otoliths, age validation should have been carried out before. If a similar species has been validated, it should be ok to use otoliths to age the species.
* Attached are several papers on taxonomy of ponyfishes, either with genus _Leiognathus_ or _Equulites_.
* Page 292 of Tuset et al. 2012 shows the shape and size of an otolith for _Equulites klunzingeri_, a related species. I expect them to be kind of similar.
* If you search for Equulites or leuciscus or leiognathus in these papers, you should find information about this species or closely related species. 
* Note that several species look quite similar so be careful to pick the right species at the markets. 
* Make sure standard length or fork length are measured for every fish specimen
* If collecting otoliths, make sure you have equipment to store them in, e.g. falcon tubes.
